Loan Prediction Machine Learning Model using Random Forest algorithm

When it comes to deciding whether an applicant’s profile is relevant to be granted with loan or not, banks have to look after many aspects.
This Machine Learning model with Python and Random Forest algorithm will predict whether the candidate’s profile is relevant or not using key features like number of dependents,education,employment status,annual income,loan amount,loan term,cibil score, residential assets value,commercial assets value,luxury assets value and bank asset value.

The basic procedures implemented to achieve the goals of this research are:

1. Data collection
2. Data cleaning and wrangling
3. Data Analysis and Visualization
4. Feature encoding
5. Train-test split validation
6. Feature scaling
7. Modeling
8. Model accuracy evaluation

a. Programming Language - Python
b. Libreary/Packages - Numpy,Pandas,MatPlotlib,Seaborn,Skikit-learn
c. Statistical Algorithm - Random Forest Tree
